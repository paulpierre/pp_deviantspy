Deviant Spy is a native advertising (RevContent) spy tool I built with my marketing partner. I developed sophisticated scraping bots in PhantomJS and NodeJS that would leverage geo proxies and pretend to be multiple user profiles. I would collect placement IDs of publishers and determine which Widget IDs would be profitable so we could run out own offers.

This helped us developed a series of profitable campaigns, as well opened the possibility of building additional sophistication to the tool.
